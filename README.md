# CloudOps Engineering Portfolio
Hands-on projects demonstrating Linux administration, infrastructure automation, monitoring, and cloud deployment (Azure &amp; AWS)

## 🌩️ CloudOps & Engineering Portfolio — David Martínez

Welcome to my **CloudOps & Engineering Portfolio**, a collection of hands-on projects that showcase my skills in **Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and Infrastructure Automation**.
This repository reflects my continuous learning path toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer, focusing on Azure, AWS, Linux, Networking, and Automation**.

Each project is designed to simulate real-world use cases, combining scripting, infrastructure management, and cloud deployment — bridging the gap between theory and professional experience.
